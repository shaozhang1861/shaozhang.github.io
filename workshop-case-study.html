          <h2>What I've Done</h2>
          <p>When I joined the Meituan Live team, most hosts manually arranged their product lists before going live. It was inefficient and inconsistent — a host's personal judgment decided which items appeared first, regardless of user context.</p>
          
          <p>I led the initiative to make the ranking intelligent. We started with data exploration: which factors truly predicted a user's purchase intent? Distance within 3 km, coupon availability, chain-store reputation, and users' saved favorites turned out to be strong signals.</p>
          
          <p>Through four A/B test cycles, we replaced intuition with algorithms. The result: <strong>+9,000 daily orders</strong>, a statistically significant uplift that exceeded most hosts' manual performance.</p>
          
          <h2>Reflections</h2>
          <p>The hardest part wasn't technical — it was cultural. Convincing non-technical stakeholders that a model could outperform human judgment required empathy and transparency.</p>
          
          <p>I learned that "explainable automation" builds trust faster than any metric chart.</p>
          
          <h2>My Takeaways</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Lead with a hypothesis, not a feature.</strong> People buy into why before what.</li>
            <li><strong>Show incremental wins.</strong> Each iteration should visibly reduce friction for real users.</li>
            <li><strong>Translate data into narrative.</strong> Explain algorithms in human terms — it earns adoption.</li>
          </ul>
